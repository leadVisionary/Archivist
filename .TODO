Add validation error to updates of records? (should a Record have a setValidator() that's called when properties are updated?)
Should Query be a model?
make read=find? delete=remove?
Archivist -> MongoArchivist -> ArbtraderArchivist

What should update do when newData has properties not in original? (ignore or error)

null or error:
 - RUD when a record with given id doesn't exist?
 



An Archive has a ValidationStrategy that corresponds to the schema of the table/validation rules for each record

Create and Update on an Archive should go through each key value pair and run the validation function defined for that key

Validation functions could include transformation code, so that say "twenty-two" would be converted to 22 before a save, or 22.4 could be rounded to 22

ValidationStrategy has keys for each property in the record and values that are functions that return true or false
